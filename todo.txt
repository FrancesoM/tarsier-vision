Poor's man Jira

+++ Bugs:
    [ ] Keep rolling buffer (max 10 segments)
        - When specifying max_segments in the pipeline, it seems to just stop saving them after 10 instead of rolling window 
    [ ] The stitching logic doesn't work probably mkv headers are not aligned
    [ ] Avoid double detection while it's technically still 
    [ ] There is no gitignore   


++  Must have:
    [ ] Double check why first sent video is high quality, the next ones are lower
    [ ] Script should be launchable as cron job
    [ ] Send text message with video, timestamp at which the person is detected
    [ ] Script docker run command

+   Nice to have 
    [ ] Run inference over whole video and draw boxes
    [ ] Use H.264 coded instead of H.265 which telegram should support already without .mp4 coversion
