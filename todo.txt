Poor's man Jira

+++ Bugs:
    [x] Keep rolling buffer (max 10 segments)
        - When specifying max_segments in the pipeline, it seems to just stop saving them after 10 instead of rolling window 
        - FIXED: manual clean up of old files, keep only 10
    [x] The stitching logic doesn't work probably mkv headers are not aligned
        - FIXED: Some files were overwritten because of wrong rolling buffer hence headers were wrong. 
    [x] Avoid double detection while it's technically still 
        - FIXED: tpu inference gated by motion. 
    [ ] There is no gitignore   


++  Must have:
    [ ] Double check why first sent video is high quality, the next ones are lower
        - This is still somehow happening, some videos are sent with slightly less w*h size
    [ ] Script should be launchable as cron job
    [x] Send text message with video, timestamp at which the person is detected
    [x] Script docker run command

+   Nice to have 
    [ ] Run inference over whole video and draw boxes
    [ ] Use H.264 coded instead of H.265 which telegram should support already without .mp4 coversion
